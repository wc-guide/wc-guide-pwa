<h2>2. General information and mandatory information</h2>

<h3>Data protection</h3>

<p>The operators of this website take the protection of your personal 
data very seriously. We treat your personal data as confidential and in 
accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this 
privacy policy.</p>

<p>If you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be 
collected. Personal information is any data with which you could be 
personally identified. This privacy policy explains what information we 
collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what 
purpose this happens.</p>

<p>Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email 
communication) may be subject to security breaches. Complete protection 
of your data from third-party access is not possible.</p>

<h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</h3>

<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express 
consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An 
informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed 
before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>

<h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>

<p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for 
the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the 
inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an 
encrypted connection in your browser’s address line when it changes from
 “http://” to “https://” and the lock icon is displayed in your 
browser’s address bar.</p>

<p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

<h3>Opposition to promotional emails</h3>

<p>We hereby expressly prohibit the use of contact data published in 
the context of website legal notice requirements with regard to sending 
promotional and informational materials not expressly requested. The 
website operator reserves the right to take specific legal action if 
unsolicited advertising material, such as email spam, is received.</p>

<h2>3. Data collection on our website</h2>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer
 and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more 
user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that 
are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p>

<p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies.” They are
 automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your 
device’s memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to
 recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p>

<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of 
cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept
 or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to 
automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always 
reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your 
browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>

<p>Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to
 provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) 
are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The 
website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to 
ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other 
cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also 
stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.</p>

<h3>Server log files</h3>

<p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information 
that your browser automatically transmits to us in “server log files”. 
These are:</p>

<ul><li>Browser type and browser version</li><li>Operating system used</li><li>Referrer URL</li><li>Host name of the accessing computer</li><li>Time of the server request</li><li>IP address</li></ul>

<p>These data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p>

<p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO, which allows 
the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary
 to a contract.</p>

<h3>Contact form</h3>

<p>Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect 
the data entered on the form, including the contact details you provide,
 to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share 
this information without your permission.</p>

<p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form
 only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO. You may revoke your 
consent at any time. An informal email making this request is 
sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still 
be legally processed.</p>

<p>We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you 
request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the 
purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your 
request). Any mandatory statutory provisions, especially those regarding
 mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.</p>

<h2>4. Analytics and advertising</h2>

<h3>Matomo (formerly Piwik)</h3>

<p>This website uses the open source web analytics service Matomo. 
Matomo uses so-called “cookies”. These are text files that are stored on
 your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by 
you. For this purpose, the information generated by the cookie about the
 use of this website is stored on our server. The IP address is 
anonymized before it is stored.</p>

<p>Matomo cookies remain on your device until you delete them.</p>

<p>The storage of Matomo cookies is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The 
website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in
 order to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>

<p>The information generated by the cookies about your use of this 
website will not be disclosed to third parties. You can prevent these 
cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your 
browser. However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will 
not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this website.</p>

<p>If you do not agree with the storage and use of your data, you can 
disable this feature here. In this case, an opt-out cookie will be 
stored in your browser to prevent Matomo from storing your usage data. 
If you delete your cookies, this will mean that the opt-out cookie will 
also be deleted. You will then need to reactivate it when you return to 
our site if you wish your activity not to be tracked.</p>
