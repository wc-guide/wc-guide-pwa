<section>
	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="general_whom">For whom or what is WC-Guide?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="general_whom">
		<p>In principle WC-Guide is for everybody. Our main focus are people who rely on public toilets in their everyday life and with the help of WC-Guide might enjoy an excursion untroubled.</p>

<section>
	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="general_data_origin">Where is the data from?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="general_data_origin">
		<p>They are from various sources. A few cities possess their own official directories, from which we were allowed to take over the data. In addition, <a href="http://www.eurokey.ch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Infirmis/Eurokey</a> provides us with their toilet data. The biggest and most important part however comes from you, the users. <strong>Thank you very much for your support !</strong></p>

	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="general_reliability">Can I trust the data ?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="general_reliability">
		<p>Our website is accessible for everyone without limitations and this can result in misuse or incorrect data. Wegenerally check all entries, but this does not prevent the occasional „rotten egg“. We do not assume responsibility for any incorrect data. If you do find an incorrectly entered detail on a toilet, please use the "Failure report“-function to correct it.</p>

	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="general_geographical_limits">Is the map limited to Switzerland ?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="general_geographical_limits">

	<div class="toggle-target" id="general_about">
		<p>The WC-Guide is a project of Sonnenschauer.net and was initiated by Corinne Grond and Adriano Fattizzo in their private time and without financial support. More information on our projects can be found on <a href="http://www.sonnenschauer.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.sonnenschauer.net</a>.</p>

<h2>Toilet types</h2>

	<div class="toggle-target" id="toilets_disabled">

<section>
	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="toilets_electric">Are disabled toilets accessible with electric-wheelchairs?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="toilets_electric">
		<p>It would be nice, if the answer was yes. Sadly „handicapped accessible“ does not automatically imply accessibility with electric-wheelchairs. In important cases please contact thethe local information point (e.g. municipality, etc).</p>
	</div>

<section>
	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="toilets_eurokey_entry">Why is it not possible to report an new Eurokey toilet?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="toilets_eurokey_entry">
		<p>Pro Infirmis/Eurokey manages a separate directory for Eurokey toilets. The required information for these toilets differs from our requirements, respectively are more detailed than needed for our website and therefore we ask youto report them directly to the Eurokey-website.</p>

<section>
	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="toilets_eurokey_info">Where do I find further information on Eurokey toilets, respectively where can I apply for such a key?</h3>

		<p>Detailed information on Eurokey toilets can be found on the website of the coordinating center Eurokey CH <a href="http://www.eurokey.ch/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.eurokey.ch</a>.

<section>
	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="toilets_nette_toilette">What is the “Nette Toilette”?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="toilets_nette_toilette">
		<p>“Nette Toilette” (German for "friendly toilet") is a free public toilet, provided by restaurants, bars etc.. The toilet can be used without obligation to consume in the appropriate place. The operators obtain an allowance from the local municipality for cleaning and maintenance. Originally from Germany this idea is spreading slowly also in Swiss cities.

<h2>About the website + instructions</h2>

<section>
	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="info_only">Why is there "only" the website and no more apps for iPhone and Android?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="info_only">
		<p>The time and money required to maintain three platforms (website, iPhone and Android app) was enormous and no longer sustainable for us, so the future of the WC-Guide became uncertain. Fortunately, the technology today is so advanced that with the help of a modern PWA website, all the functions we need can be covered by a modern browser. So only one platform is needed for all systems and the continuity of the WC-Guide is secured.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="info_benefit">What are the benefits of the new website, resp. PWA?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="info_benefit">
		<p>With the help of modern browser technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3, all required features of the WC-Guide such as location determination can be covered.</p>
		<p>A website built with these technologies and PWA behaves like a native app, and offers some advantages over a normal website, such as offline usage.</p>
		<p>Calling the website wc-guide.com and setting it up as an app is all it takes.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="info_installation_pwa">How do I set up the webpage as an app on my smartphone?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="info_installation_pwa">
		<p>This instruction is only necessary for the first call of the website up to the installation of the app. After that the WC-Guide can be started like a normal app via the icon.</p>
		<p><strong>iPhone:</strong></p>
		<p>
			<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;padding-left: 1.2em;">
				<li>With Safari go to the website <a href="https://wc-guide.com">wc-guide.com.</a></li>
				<li>Select the Share icon [↑] in the navigation bar at the bottom center.</li>
				<li>Choose "Add to Home Screen" [+]</li>
				<li>Enter desired name for the icon or just leave "WC-Guide".</li>
				<li>Choose "Add". The app will now be created and the WC-Guide can be used in fullscreen.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p><strong>Android:</strong></p>
		<p>
			<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;padding-left: 1.2em;">
				<li>In Google Chrome go to <a href="https://wc-guide.com">wc-guide.com</a>.</li>
				<li>Select the banner with the question "Do you want to install the app on the start screen".</li>
				<li>Confirm it and the app will be created. The WC-Guide can now be started in fullscreen.</li>
			</ul>

<section>
	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="info_apps_usable">Can I still use the old apps for iPhone and Android?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="info_apps_usable">
		<p>Yes and no. Currently the app still works, but it will not be further developed by us. If Apple or Google updates iOS or Android with deeper changes, the WC-Guide app may not work properly anymore. In any case, we recommend that you use the new website in your browser or as a PWA app so you're always up-to-date with the current version.</p>
